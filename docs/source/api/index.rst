The following details the major classes and functions used in ``swxg``, organized by the corresponding script in the GitHub repository. Nested functions can be referenced in the GitHub repository as well. Note that you will only ever need to interface with ``SWXGModel``, however this page is an attempt at transparency about how exactly the fits are being performed, how the generation is accomplished, and how validation is assessed.
